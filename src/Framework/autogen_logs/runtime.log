Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations.

However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act.

Certain tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA\\u2019s jurisdiction to products \\u201ccontaining nicotine from any source,\\u201d not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of \\u201ctobacco product\\u201d under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. Tobacco products, including ENDS and e-liquid products, containing nicotine from any source, must be in compliance with the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations. For more information, please see https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/ctp-newsroom/requirements-products-made-non-tobacco-nicotine-take-effect-april-14.\\n\\nGenerally, to be legally marketed in the United States, the FD&C Act requires \\u201cnew tobacco products\\u201d to have a premarket authorization order in effect. A \\u201cnew tobacco product\\u201d is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007 (section 910(a) of the FD&C Act; 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(a)). Generally, a marketing authorization order under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387j(c)(1)(A)(i)) is required for a new tobacco product unless (1) the manufacturer of the product submitted a report under section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)) and FDA issues an order finding the product substantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product (section 910(a)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act) or (2) the manufacturer submitted a report under section 905(j)(1)(A)(ii) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(1)(A)(ii)) and all modifications are covered by exemptions from the requirements of substantial equivalence granted by FDA under section 905(j)(3) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)(3)).\\n\\nNew Tobacco Products Without Required Marketing Authorization are Adulterated and Misbranded\\n\\nFDA has determined that you offer for sale or distribution to customers in the United States ENDS and e-liquid products that lack a marketing authorization order: Cereal Trip - Bad Drip Lab 60mL \\u2013 3mg, Don\\u2019t Care Bear by Bad Drip Labs 60ml \\u2013 3mg, and Funky Republic Ti7000 Smart Disposable - Blue Red Mint.\\n\\nThe tobacco products listed above are new tobacco products because they were not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007. These products do not have FDA marketing authorization orders in effect under section 910(c)(1)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act and are not otherwise exempt from the marketing authorization requirement. Therefore, these products are adulterated under section 902(6)(A) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387b(6)(A)). In addition, they are misbranded under section 903(a)(6) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387c(a)(6)) because a notice or other information respecting these products was not provided as required by section 905(j) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 387e(j)).\\n\\nAdditional Considerations\\n\\nFDA finds some of these products particularly concerning because the design of the Bad Drip Labs e-liquid products (see Exhibits A) are likely to appeal to youth by imitating a prescription pill bottle (see Exhibits B). Specifically, the overall presentation of the e-liquid products, including the graphical elements on their labeling and/or advertising, makes it appear that the products are a prescription and could reasonably result in a child or adult ingesting the products. Further, the products are likely to appeal to youth because they enable youth to conceal a tobacco product from parents, teachers, or other adults. FDA is concerned about the rising youth appeal and dramatic rise in youth use of e-liquid products. Any efforts to entice youth to use tobacco products are of concern to FDA. Sales of such unauthorized tobacco products are prohibited, and FDA is concerned that your actions likely encourage unlawful sales, maintain or increase youth use, and contribute to the public health and safety concerns associated with e-liquid products.\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion and Requested Actions\\n\\nFDA has determined that your firm markets new tobacco products in the United States that lack premarket authorization. All new tobacco products on the market without the statutorily required premarket authorization are marketed unlawfully and are subject to enforcement action at FDA\\u2019s discretion.\\n\\nFor a list of products that received marketing granted orders, please visit our website: https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/market-and-distribute-tobacco-product/tobacco-products-marketing-orders#PMTAView%20all%20marketing%20granted.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to ensure that all tobacco products you sell and/or distribute in the United States and all related labeling and/or advertising on any websites or other media (such as e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), and in any retail establishments in which you advertise, comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA\\u2019s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. \\u00a7 301 et seq. or its implementing regulations relating to tobacco products including the tobacco regulations in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, or 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. However, this Warning Letter does not constitute \\u201cwritten notice\\u201d for purposes of section 303(f)(9)(B)(i)(II) of the FD&C Act. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated and/or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.\\n\\nThe violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should take prompt action to address any violations that are referenced above and take any necessary actions to bring these tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.\\n\\nPlease submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring these products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that these products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA\\u2019s homepage at\\nhttp://www.fda.gov.\\n\\nPlease note your reference number, RW2402159, in your response and direct your response via email at CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov and to the following address:\\n\\nDPAL-WL Response, Office of Compliance and Enforcement\\nFDA Center for Tobacco Products\\nc/o Document Control Center\\nBuilding 71, Room G335\\n10903 New Hampshire Avenue\\nSilver Spring, MD 20993-0002\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact CTPCompliance@fda.hhs.gov.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n/S/\\n\\nJill Atencio\\nActing Director\\nOffice of Compliance and Enforcement\\nCenter for Tobacco Products\\n\\nVIA UPS and Electronic Mail\\n\\ncc:\\n\\n1 Stop Vapor\\n2809 SW 44th Street\\nOklahoma City, OK 73119\\n\\nGoDaddy.com, LLC\\nabuse@godaddy.com\\n\\nBigcommerce Inc.\\nabuse@bigcommerce.com\", \"role\": \"user\", \"name\": \"Init\"}, \"sender\": \"chat_manager\", \"valid\": true}", "timestamp": "2024-12-16 17:14:50.040770", "thread_id": 14225272832}
